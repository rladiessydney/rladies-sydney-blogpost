# R-Ladies Sydney blog post template

The repository contains three folders:

- `rmarkdown`: The R Markdown file (.Rmd) for the post goes here, and the HTML output and any generated files will be written to this folder
- `[date]-[postslug]_staticfiles`: Files not generated by R should be placed here. 
- `style`: CSS and pandoc templates to let you preview the post in *roughly* the form it will have when it goes on the blog :-)

More documentation to come!
