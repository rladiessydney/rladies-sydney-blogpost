# Chapter 1

It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune must be in want of a wife.

However little known the feelings or views of such a man may be on his first entering a neighbourhood, this truth is so well fixed in the minds of the surrounding families, that he is considered as the rightful property of some one or other of their daughters.

Etc.

- This is an unordered list
- *This list item is italicised*
- **This one is boldface**
- `This text is verbatim`

1. An ordered list
2. with two items

Sometimes it is nice to show the results of an R expression like `weekdays(as.Date("1813-01-28"))` inline. That way we find out that *Pride and Prejudice* was published on a `r weekdays(as.Date("1813-01-28"))`. Code blocks look like this:

```{r name-of-the-chunk}
PPdate <- as.Date("1813-01-28")
PPday <- weekdays(PPdate)
print(PPday)
```

An R chunk that does some basic image manipulation and plotting using the [imager](https://dahtah.github.io/imager/imager.html) package:


```{r a-picture, fig.width=4, fig.height=4, fig.align='center'}
# load packages
library(imager, quietly = TRUE, warn.conflicts = FALSE)
library(magrittr)

# specify the file path
rladieslogo <- "../1813-01-28-my-post_staticfiles/logo.png"

# specify a mapping function
map <- function(x,y) {
  list(
    x=exp(y/1000)*x,
    y=y*exp(-sin(x/60))
  )
} 

# load, warp & plot the logo
rladieslogo %>% load.image %>% imwarp(map=map) %>% plot(axes=FALSE)
```


You can write LaTeX equations inline, like this $(x-\mu)^2$, but larger ones probably look nicer this way:
$$
\frac{1}{\sigma\sqrt{2\pi}} \exp \left( -\frac{(x-\mu)^2}{2\sigma^2} \right)
$$
